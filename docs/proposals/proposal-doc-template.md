# ORAS Enhancement Proposal Template

A ORAS Enhancement Proposal (OEP) is a way to propose, communicate and coordinate on new features and enhancements for the `ORAS` project. It aims to provide a consistent format for proposing new features and improvements, ensures contributors follow a structured approach, making it easier for maintainers to review proposals.

OEPs are suggested for most non-trivial changes. Specifically:

- Anything that may be controversial
- Most new features (except the small changes to existing flags or parameters)
- Changes that are wide ranging or impact most of the project and users
